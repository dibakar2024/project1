Leave Application for Another Medical Checkup, 06/09/2022

You all know that I have been suffering from gastrological disease for quite some time, so the doctor said to go for another checkup with all medical test reports on 6th September, 2022. I kindly request you to grant me leave on the above mentioned day and make this leave as an informed leave.

Respected Sir/Mam,
Lately my health is not going well. I am suffering gas/acidity/chest pain..etc. On 22nd September I went to office for WFO and after office I went my rented flat for stay the night. On 23rd September I had to be admitted to the emergency ward at Apollo at 3:00am, because I suffered too much chest pain. Then my friend booked the cab and went to Apollo emergency ward for treatment. On morning emergency department released me and asked for check-up a gastrologycal specialist immediately. On 24th again I went to the gastrology doctor for proper treatment. The doctor advised take rest and prohibited any outside food that moment. But if I go to office for WFO, I have to eat outside and the problem will increase. 
So, I request you if you extend my work from home facility for another 1-2 months then it will be very helpful for me. Please oblige me by this facility.
